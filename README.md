# Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Opens an electron window with developer tools open.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn electron-pack`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
