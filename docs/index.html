      <ul>
        <li>Extract and merge your Google Photos export from Google Takeout.</li>
        <li>Organize your photos into folders by year and month.</li>
        <li>Optionally rename your photos to a <code>year-month-day hour:minute:second number.extension</code> naming convention</li>
        <li>Fix all file created and modified dates as they are organized.</li>
        <li>Optionally copy all available metadata provided by Google Takeout in <code>.json</code> files back into the image/video files.</li>
        <li>Remind you to clean up after processing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Planned Additions</h3>

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <article>
      <p>
        After downloading the correct file for your computer, you will need to exract the contents before you can run the program.
        Once you have extracted the program, find the <code>GooglePhotosExportOrganizer</code> executable within and double-click
        it to run the program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the program is open, simply follow the instructions within.

    <h2>FAQs &amp; Known Issues</h2>
    <article>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <strong>Q:</strong> What language will ensure the best compatibility with my Google Photos export?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <strong>A:</strong> English is the only automatically-supported language at this time. Google Photos exports from other
          languages may run into problems until we figure out a good way to add international support.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <strong>Q:</strong> The Extract process failed to extract all my <code>.zip</code> files! What can I do?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <strong>A:</strong> We recommend separating your <code>.zip</code> files that failed into a separate folder and re-running
          the app on that folder with the output set to the original output folder that worked. This should extract the rest of the
          files correctly, and we're working on a fix for a future update.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <strong>Q:</strong> The Extract process has been running for more than X hours, but there are still some <code>.zip</code>
          files that have not been extracted... What should I do?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <strong>A:</strong> You probably have a lot of <code>.zip</code> files, so something probably just went wrong during the
          process and the application didn't tell you. Stop the process (may require closing &amp; restarting the app) and follow
          the instructions in the previous answer.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <strong>Q:</strong> After running the Organize process, there are a lot of files left in the original Google Photos folder!
          What's going on?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <strong>A:</strong> The Google Photos Export Organizer app uses <code>.json</code> medata files provided in the Google
          Photos export to identify what files to move. Typically, files without <code>.json</code> files associated with them are
          edited versions of the original file and might have a number after them indicating that they are duplicates. These files
          are left in the original folder so you can check and organize them manually yourself if you wish, but the original files
          with the associated <code>.json</code> files should be correctly organized!
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <strong>Q:</strong> I checked the files left in the Google Photos folder, and they have <code>.json</code> files but were
          not moved! What's wrong with them?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <strong>A:</strong> This likely has to do with the problem of only English being automatically supported, specifically US
          English. If you open some of your <code>.json</code> files in a text editor, you should be able to find a <code>photoTakenDate</code>
          entry, and within that a <code>formatted</code> entry. The code attempts to parse that <code>formatted</code> value directly
          into a JavaScript Date object, which unfortunately only recognizes certain formats of date and time, and typically only in
          English. We have an idea of how to fix it, but will need a bit of time before we can test international dates.<br />
          One option in the meantime is to change your Google interface to English before running your export. It's far from ideal,
          but it might make this app work for you!
